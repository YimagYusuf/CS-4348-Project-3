# CS-4348-Project-3

The files in the project are:

Project3: My code for this project
Devlog: has all my devlogs throughout my project

to run the program you can just write "python Project3.py" into the terminal.

Comments:
I forgot to add some of the devlogs the day I did them, and just added them to it's correct date when I remembered. Sorry about that, but everything is still correctly labled.
