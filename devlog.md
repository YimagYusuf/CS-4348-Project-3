Give your thoughts so far. Have you had new thoughts about the project since the last session? It is alright for this par to be empty if there have been no new developments between
session, but you should try to fill it in when you can.
What do you plan to accomplish this session? Layout a plan, as detailed as possible. What
do you plan to change? What do you plan to implement next? What is your goal for this
session?

Once done for the session, add new entry to your devlog. The heading should be the current
date and time. Reflect on the session. Did you encounter an problems you have not already
wrote about? Did you accomplish your goal for this session? If not, why? Did you accomplish
more you have not written about? Record it now. What are you thinking about doing the next
session?



(Added these 2 later than I did it (12/3 and 12/4), I forgot to add them then, so I added them now)
# 12/3/24
Started working on the menu of the project very first commit initial commit

# 12/04/24 @ 10pm

A. I had come new thought on my menu and how i want it to look like, and my functions, but havent implemented them yet. I planed to get the menu, and unimplemented functions. I plan to implenet the functions and btree next, as I completed my goal for this session
I had come new thought on my menu and how i want it to look like, and my functions, but havent implemented them yet. I plan to accomplish my menu, along with just a basic sketch of my classes, and functions. I plan to change the classes as I have nothing down for them right now, and plan to implement being able to create a node for now. My goal is to have my menu running with user inputs.

B.I havent encountered any problem this session as I had it be a pretty light session. I acomplished my goal of creating the menu and basic layout of my classes. I havent accomplished more than what I have written about as I kept this day kind of light. In the next session I am thinking about implementing most of the functions like create, open, seach, insert, print, and leaving soem of them unfinished for now. 



# 12/07/24 @ 5pm

A. I havent really had any new thoughts on it so far. I have just been trying to implement the functions I labeled a few days ago. I plan to accomplish the insert and search methods, along with creating and opening files. I plan to change my btree class to now implement these functions, instead of not having one. I plan to start with creating files, and opening them, then I wish to insert them, and also having the btree manage itself. My goal is to have the create, open, insert, search and print. 

# 12/08/24 @ 2:30 am

B. I have encountered lots of problems when I havent wrote about. For example getting the Btree to sel manage itself was really hard. Things werent adjusting, the splitting wasnt working, I couldnt figure out how to get the values and push it to another node for a split. i did infact accomplish my goal, I ended up pushing through my problems, and figuring out how to do it. I haven't accomplished more that I havent written, and in the next session I hope to have load and extract done and finish this project.


# 12/08/24 @ 5pm

A. I had some new thoughts on how I was gonna fix the be tree to split and rearrange itself. I plan to finish the b-tree managing for this session. I plan to change the insert to be able to split and create children for when its over 19 keys. I also plan to have search be able to search in children nodes as well. My goal is to finish these menetioned implementations, then move on to the load and extract.
